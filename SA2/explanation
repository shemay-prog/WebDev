Explanation:

Minimalist design:
I used minimal layout and a lot of white space to improve readability and user engagement. Minimalism is a modern design trends that prioritize simplicity and clarity over cluttered interfaces.	

Color scheme:
I used off-colors, specifically subtle tones like #F0EBE3 and #FFEFEF, to maintain visual consistency and create a calming, professional aesthetic. These colors create a gentle background that enhances readability without overwhelming the viewer. The use of muted tones fits into current design trends that favor understated elegance and sophistication.

Typography:
To make the name stand out and create hierarchy, I used bold headings to ensure consistency and easy reading.

Profile Image:
I used a shadow effect to create visual interest and make the profile image stand out. By adding a shadow, the image can pop against the background and create a three-dimensional feel without disrupting the minimalist aesthetic.
