                                <br><br>PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (THE “TERMS”) CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OF INSTRUCTURE, INC. (“INSTRUCTURE”) WITH LINKS TO THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE “WEBSITE”) IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING USING THE SERVICES ENABLED VIA THE WEBSITE (THE “SERVICES”) BY INSTRUCTURE OR USERS OF THE SITE (“USERS”), CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” CHECK BOX, OR MERELY BROWSING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.
                                
                                <br><br>The Services include, but are not limited to, a learning management system that entities (“ENTITIES”) may subscribe to and provide to their instructors and learners (“INSTRUCTORS” and “LEARNERS”) in connection with courses (each, a “COURSE”). Instructure provides an account that enables a designated User to manage the Services, manage Learner and Instructor access to the Services, and provide general support on behalf of an Entity. “User” means any user of the Services, including Learners, and Instructors.
                                
                                <br><br>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY INSTRUCTURE IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME.

If we make any material changes, and you have registered to use the Services, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you provided to us. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new Users of the Website or Services and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the Website for existing User.

If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the Website and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the Website and/or the Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.
                                
                                <br><br>1. USE OF THE SERVICES AND INSTRUCTURE PROPERTIES. The Website, the Services, and the information and content made available (“CONTENT”) by Instructure on the Website and in the Services (collectively, the “INSTRUCTURE PROPERTIES”) are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to the Terms, Instructure grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of the Instructure Properties for the sole purpose of using the Services for your personal purposes or, in the event you are an Instructor, your educational purposes.
                                
                                <br><br>1.1 APPLICATION LICENSE. Instructure also provides a mobile application (the “APPLICATION”) for use with the Services. Your use of the Application is governed by the End User License Agreement that accompanies the Application in the marketplace where you download it.
                                
                                <br><br>1.2 CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. The rights granted to you in the Terms are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Instructure Properties, (b) you shall not use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other Instructure Properties; (c) you shall not use any metatags or other “hidden text” using Instructure’s name or trademarks; (d) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Instructure Properties except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (e) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices, or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools, or the like) to “scrape” or download data from any web pages contained in the Website; (f) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Instructure Properties may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (g) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Instructure Properties. Any future release, update or other addition to the Instructure Properties shall be subject to the Terms. Instructure, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of the Instructure Properties terminates the licenses granted by Instructure pursuant to the Terms.
                                
                                <br><br>2. REGISTRATION. In order to access certain features of the Instructure Properties you must create an account (“ACCOUNT”) by providing necessary information when registering (“REGISTRATION DATA”) and accept the Terms.
                                
                                <br><br>2.1 REGISTRATION DATA. In registering for the Services, you agree to (1) provide true, current, and complete Registration Data; and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, current, and complete. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You may not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to notify Instructure immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security. You agree not to create or access an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account at any given time. You agree not to create an Account or use the Instructure Properties if you have been previously removed by Instructure, or if you have been previously banned from any of the Instructure Properties.
                                
                                <br><br>2.2 NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE. You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the Instructure Properties, including but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to connect with and use the Application.

                                <br><br>3. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTENT.
                                
                                <br><br>3.1 TYPES OF CONTENT. You acknowledge that all Content, including the Instructure Properties, is the sole responsibility of the party from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Instructure, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available (“MAKE AVAILABLE”) through the Instructure Properties (“YOUR CONTENT”). Other Users of the Instructure Properties, and not Instructure, are similarly responsible for all Content such other Users Make Available through the Instructure Properties (“USER CONTENT”).
                                
                                <br><br>3.2 NO OBLIGATION TO PRE-SCREEN CONTENT. You acknowledge that Instructure has no obligation to pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, Your Content and User Content), although Instructure reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that (1) violates any law or regulation, (2) violates these Terms, including the User Code of Conduct set forth in Section 4.4 hereof, and/or (3) otherwise creates liability for Instructure.
                                
                                <br><br>4. OWNERSHIP.
                                
                                <br><br>4.1 INSTRUCTURE PROPERTIES. Except with respect to Your Content and User Content, you agree that Instructure and its suppliers own all rights, title and interest in the Instructure Properties. Instructure’s name and other related graphics, logos, service marks and trade names used on or in connection with the Instructure Properties are the trademarks of Instructure and may not be used without permission in connection with any third-party products or services. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names that may appear on or in the Instructure Properties are the property of their respective owners.
                                
                                <br><br>4.2 YOUR CONTENT. Your Content shall at all times remain your sole property and you agree that you have no right, title or interest in or to any other Content that appears on or in the Instructure Properties. You represent that you have all necessary right, power and authority to post Your Content to the Instructure Properties. You agree to allow Instructure and its applicable contractors to freely host, reproduce, transmit, modify, display and otherwise use Your Content (in whole or in part) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services to you, and in accordance with Instructure’s agreement with your Entity, if applicable.
                                
                                <br><br>4.3 YOUR ACCOUNT. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, by submitting Your Content to any forums, comments or any other area on or in the Instructure Properties, you hereby expressly permit Instructure to identify you by your username as the contributor of Your Content in any publication in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed in connection with Your Content.
                                
                                <br><br>4.4 USER CODE OF CONDUCT. As a condition of use, you agree not to use the Instructure Properties for any purpose that is prohibited by the Terms or by applicable law. Do not post, or permit others to post, content on the Instructure Properties or on your profile that (i) encourages illegal activities, is fraudulent, or is unlawful; (ii) insults, defames, harasses, or threatens others; (iii) violates the copyright or intellectual property or privacy rights of others; (iv) contains obscene, vulgar, pornographic, or libelous material; (v) harms or impersonates others, including other Users; or (vi) advertises or sells a product or service. Do not reproduce content from your Course or other Learners unless allowed by the express copyright terms laid out by the Instructor (e.g. Creative Commons). Do not share the solutions to assignments with others unless this is expressly authorized by the Instructor. Do not submit the work of others as your own work. Respect the privacy of other Users. Respect the diversity of opinions and cultures that will be presented by other Users. Do not attempt or engage in, any potentially harmful acts that are directed against the Instructure Properties, including but not limited to violating or attempting to violate any security features of the Instructure Properties, introducing viruses, worms, or similar harmful code into the Instructure Properties, or interfering or attempting to interfere with use of the Instructure Properties by any other user, host or network, including by means of overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mail bombing,” or “crashing” the Instructure Properties. If you believe that someone has violated this code of conduct, begin by notifying the Instructor of the Course. If the issue is not addressed by the Instructor to your satisfaction, contact conduct@canvas.net with your concerns.
                                
                                <br><br>4.5 FEEDBACK. You agree that submission of any ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals to Instructure through its suggestion, feedback, wiki, forum or similar pages (“FEEDBACK”) is at your own risk and that Instructure has no obligations (including without limitation obligations of confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to Instructure a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Feedback, and to sublicense the foregoing rights, in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Instructure Properties.
                                
                                <br><br>5. INVESTIGATIONS. Instructure may, but is not obligated to, monitor or review the Instructure Properties and Content at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, Instructure shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to remove any of Your Content for any reason (or no reason), including if such Content violates the Terms or any applicable law. Although Instructure does not generally monitor user activity occurring in connection with the Instructure Properties, if Instructure becomes aware of any possible violations by you of any provision of the Terms, Instructure reserves the right to investigate such violations, and Instructure may, at its sole discretion, terminate your license to use the Instructure Properties, or change, alter or remove Your Content, in whole or in part.
                                
                                <br><br>6. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS.
                                
                                <br><br>6.1 USER RESPONSIBILITY. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users of the Services and any other parties with whom you interact through the Services; provided, however, that Instructure reserves the right, but has no obligation, to intercede in disputes among Users. You agree that Instructure will not be responsible for any liabilities incurred as the result of such interaction.
                                
                                <br><br>6.2 CONTENT PROVIDED BY OTHER USERS. The Instructure Properties may contain User Content provided by other Users. Instructure is not responsible for and does not control User Content. Instructure has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse or make any representations or warranties with respect to User Content. You use all User Content and interact with other Users at your own risk.
                                
                                <br><br>7. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.
                                
                                <br><br>7.1 THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES. The Instructure Properties may contain links to third-party websites (“THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES”). When you click on a link to a Third-Party Website, we will not warn you that you have left the Instructure Properties and are subject to separate terms and conditions or privacy policies. Such Third-Party Websites are not under the control of Instructure. Instructure is not responsible for any Third-Party Websites and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Websites, or their products or services. You use all links in Third-Party Websites at your own risk. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Websites, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third-party.

If you have breached any provision of the Terms, or if Instructure is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application, or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Instructure has the right to suspend or terminate any Services provided to you or to delete any of Your Content. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Instructure’s sole discretion and that Instructure shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your Account.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
                                
                                <br><br>13.3 ASSIGNMENT.

                                <br><br>13.8 WAIVER. Any waiver or failure by Instructure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
                                
                                <br><br>13.9 SEVERABILITY.

                                <br><br>13.10 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
